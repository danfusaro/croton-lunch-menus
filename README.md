Certainly, you can modify the Automator script to use an existing Bash script called `download_monthly_menu.sh`. Here are the updated steps:

1. **Create or Locate the Bash Script:**

   Ensure that your existing Bash script, `download_monthly_menu.sh`, is in a directory you can easily reference.

2. **Open Automator:**

   Open the "Automator" application on your Mac.

3. **Create a New Document:**

   Choose "Calendar Alarm" when Automator prompts you to select the document type and click "Choose."

4. **Build Your Workflow:**

   In the left pane, search for "Run Shell Script" and drag it into the right pane.

5. **Configure the Shell Script:**

   In the "Run Shell Script" action, you need to specify the shell (`/bin/bash`) and provide the full path to your `download_monthly_menu.sh` script. You can also pass arguments if your script expects any.

   For example, if your script is located at `/path/to/your/download_monthly_menu.sh`, your action would look like:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash /path/to/your/download_monthly_menu.sh
   ```

6. **Save the Workflow:**

   Go to "File" > "Save..." and give your workflow a name (e.g., "MonthlyScript"). Save it in a location of your choice.

7. **Schedule the Calendar Event:**

   Open the "Calendar" app on your Mac.

8. **Create a New Event:**

   In Calendar, create a new event for the day and time you want the script to run each month.

9. **Set Up an Alert:**

   In the event details, set up an alert by clicking "Add Alert" and selecting "Custom..." from the drop-down menu.

10. **Choose Your Workflow:**

    In the "Custom" alert, select "Open file" and choose the Automator workflow you created in step 6 ("MonthlyScript.workflow").

11. **Save the Event:**

    Save the event with the configured alert.

Now, each month when the scheduled event triggers, your Automator script will run the existing Bash script `download_monthly_menu.sh`.

Ensure that the Bash script (`download_monthly_menu.sh`) and the Automator workflow (`MonthlyScript.workflow`) are correctly configured and located in accessible directories.
